          School life was (and is) never easy, so students found ways to have as much fun as possible during breaks. Instead of using their phones, students during the late 1990s-2000s would play the Chapteh. The game is played on a rectangular field, with two teams of 7 players on each side. The objective of the game is to kick a small, lightweight shuttlecock over a high net using only the feet.
